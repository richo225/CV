<p>I'm a neuroscientist turned junior full stack developer. I have traded dissecting mice brains for designing web applications by jumping feet first into an intensive 12-week software development course at <a href="https://github.com/makersacademy">Makers Academy</a>.</p>
<h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>
<h4 id="fast-learner">Fast learner</h4>
<ul>
<li>I am confident in my ability to quickly learn any new technology following the intense nature of the Makers Academy course.</li>
<li>For my final project, five weeks into learning Javascript and with no front end framework experience, my team and I completed a multi-platform mobile app built on top of NativeScript utilising TypeScript and Angular 2. None of these technologies were taught on the course, yet within two weeks <a href="https://github.com/MakeItStop/task-based-alarm">MakeItStop!</a> was presented and now awaits the app store!</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="systematic-thinker">Systematic thinker</h4>
<ul>
<li>My scientific training has helped immensely in my approach to coding, by following logical steps and breaking down a complex task into smaller, distinct components.</li>
<li>Makers Academy have instilled in me a problem-solving mindset to successfully debug code whilst also reducing its need via clean, maintainable code written in a test-driven manner. The rare bugs that do get through are squashed immediately!</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="team-player">Team player</h4>
<ul>
<li>Having pair programmed throughout the Makers Academy course, I have learned to be an effective partner in communicating ideas, technical terms and thought processes.</li>
<li>My time as a junior research scientist in a Neurovascular laboratory involved the presenting and sharing of results on a weekly basis to peers and collaborators from other departments and laboratories across Germany.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="drive">Drive</h4>
<ul>
<li>I completed the intense bootcamp as a remote student. This required a great amount of will and discipline - skills that have been central in making the exciting career switch.</li>
<li>This drive and determination is reiterated by my final project team members:</li>

<p><em>&quot;Some people have told me they don't think a fat penguin really embodies the grace of Linux, which just tells me they have never seen an angry penguin charging at them in excess of 100 mph. They'd be a lot more careful about what they say if they had.&quot;</em> - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/linustorvalds">Linus Torvalds</a></p>

I'm a neuroscientist turned junior full stack developer. I have traded dissecting mice brains for designing web applications by jumping feet first into an intensive 12-week software development course at [Makers Academy](https://github.com/makersacademy).

Skills
------
#### Fast learner
- I am confident in my ability to quickly learn any new technology following the intense nature of the Makers Academy course.
- For my final project, five weeks into learning Javascript and with no front end framework experience, my team and I completed a multi-platform mobile app built on top of NativeScript utilising TypeScript and Angular 2. None of these technologies were taught on the course, yet within two weeks [MakeItStop!](https://github.com/MakeItStop/task-based-alarm) was presented and now awaits the app store!

#### Systematic thinker
- My scientific training has helped immensely in my approach to coding, by following logical steps and breaking down a complex task into smaller, distinct components.
- Makers Academy have instilled in me a problem-solving mindset to successfully debug code whilst also reducing its need via clean, maintainable code written in a test-driven manner. The rare bugs that do get through are squashed immediately!

#### Team player
- Having pair programmed throughout the Makers Academy course, I have learned to be an effective partner in communicating ideas, technical terms and thought processes.
- My time as a junior research scientist in a Neurovascular laboratory involved the presenting and sharing of results on a weekly basis to peers and collaborators from other departments and laboratories across Germany.

#### Drive
- I completed the intense bootcamp as a remote student. This required a great amount of will and discipline - skills that have been central in making the exciting career switch.
- This drive and determination is reiterated by my final project team members:

Reviews

*"Showed fantastic initiative when coding tasks for the app."* - [Luke Cartledge](https://github.com/lukecartledge)  

*"Highly driven, focused and committed!"* - [Prashant Mathias](https://github.com/prashantmathias)  

*"A self starter. Hardworking and determined to complete the project."* - [Sam Broughton](https://github.com/samjbro)  

*"Some people have told me they don't think a fat penguin really embodies the grace of Linux, which just tells me they have never seen an angry penguin charging at them in excess of 100 mph. They'd be a lot more careful about what they say if they had."* - [Linus Torvalds](https://www.linkedin.com/in/linustorvalds)

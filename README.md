Richard Bates
=============

A junior level Software Developer passionate about creating web applications. As a former biochemist, I jumped feet first into an intensive 16-week web development course at Makers Academy in order to turn a tinkered with hobby into a realistic career. I am now looking for a role as a junior developer, in order to join those who are able to do what they love as a career.

Skills
------
#### Quick learner
I am confident in my ability to quickly learn any new technology following the intense nature of the Makers Academy course. For my final project, five weeks into learning Javascript and with no front end framework experience, I completed a multi-platform mobile app built on top of Nativescript utilising Typescript and Angular 2. None of these technologies were taught on the course, yet within two weeks [MakeItStop!](https://github.com/MakeItStop/task-based-alarm) was presented and awaits the market.

#### Team player
- Contributing member of a Neurovascular research group with weekly presentations and lab collaborations.
- Multiple weekly projects with other Makers Academy students.

#### Self motivated
- Something to do with remote course
- Reviews "    " etc.

#### Software/Web Development & Testing
-
